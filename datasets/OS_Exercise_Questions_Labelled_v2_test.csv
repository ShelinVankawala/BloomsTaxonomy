The producer always manages to append a new element to the buffer and signal during the consumption of the previous element by the consumer. The producer is always appending to an empty buffer and the consumer is always taking the sole item in the buffer. Although the consumer never blocks on the semaphore, a large number of calls to the semaphore mechanism is made, creating considerable overhead. Construct a new program that will be more efficient under these circumstances. Hints: Allow n to have the value â€“1, which is to mean that not only is the buffer empty but that the consumer has detected this fact and is going to block until the producer supplies fresh data.",,Create,,,,

"In 1978, Dijkstra put forward the conjecture that there was no solution to the mutual exclusion problem avoiding starvation, applicable to an unknown but finite number of processes, using a finite number of weak semaphores. In 1979, J. M. Morris refuted this conjecture by publishing an algorithm using three weak semaphores. The behavior of the algorithm can be described as follows: If one or several process are waiting in a semWait(S) operation and another process is executing semSignal(S), the value of the semaphore S is not modified and one of the waiting processes is unblocked independently of semWait(S). Apart from the three semaphores, the algorithm uses two nonnegative integer variables as counters of the number of processes in certain sections of the algorithm. Thus, semaphores A and B are initialized to 1, while semaphore M and counters NA and NM are initialized to 0. The mutual exclusion semaphore B protects access to the shared variable NA. A process attempting to enter its critical section must cross two barriers represented by semaphores A and M. Counters NA and NM, respectively, contain the number of processes ready to cross barrier A and those having already crossed barrier A but not yet barrier M. In the second part of the protocol, the NM processes blocked at M will enter their critical sections one by one, using a cascade technique similar to that used in the first part.

"Consider the following sequence of page references (each element in the sequence represents a page number): 12345213323454511325 1<<k Define the mean working set size after the kth reference as sk( ) = k a 0 W(t, ) 0 t=1 1k and define the missing page probability after the kth reference as mk( ) = k a F(t, ) t=1 where F(t,  )   1 if a page fault occurs at virtual time t and 0 otherwise. Draw a diagram similar to that of Figure 8.19 for the reference sequence just defined for the values     1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Plot s20( ) as a function of  . Plot m20( ) as a function of  .",,Apply,,,,

"Because of the known risks of the UNIX password system, the SunOS-4.0 documentation recommends that the password file be removed and replaced with a publicly readable file called /etc/publickey. An entry in the file for user A consists of a userâ€™s identifier IDA, the userâ€™s public key, PUa, and the corresponding private key, PRa. This private key is encrypted using DES with a key derived from the userâ€™s login password Pa. When A logs in, the system decrypts E(Pa, PRa) to obtain PRa. How can an opponent attack this system?",,Understand,,,,
